            <h2> Hobbies </h2>

            <p>
                When I'm not working or learning, I love spending my free time engaging in activities that bring me joy and relaxation. One of my favorite pastimes is playing video games, as they challenge my creativity and problem-solving skills. I enjoy exploring different genres, from fast-paced action games to strategy-based puzzles, as each provides a unique way to engage my mind. Video games also offer an opportunity to connect with friends and share exciting experiences, whether we're competing or collaborating on a mission.
            </p>

            <p>
                Basketball is another passion of mine, offering a fun way to stay active and bond with friends. Whether it's a casual game at the park or shooting hoops alone basketball helps me clear my mind and stay physically fit. The sport has also taught me valuable lessons about teamwork, resilience, and focus—qualities that I apply to other aspects of my life.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I also enjoy riding my bike through the scenic routes near my home, as it helps me disconnect and recharge. There's something incredibly refreshing about feeling the wind on my face and taking in the natural beauty around me. On longer rides, I often discover new areas, making each outing a mini-adventure.
            </p>

            <p>
                Tinkering with technology is another favorite activity of mine. Whether it's building small gadgets, experimenting with software tools, or troubleshooting tech issues, I find immense satisfaction in solving problems and understanding how things work. It's a creative outlet that fuels my curiosity and supports my passion for learning.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lastly, trying out new foods and cuisines is an adventure I always look forward to, blending my love for travel and culinary exploration. Whether it's discovering a hidden gem in my neighborhood or experimenting with recipes at home, exploring flavors from around the world brings excitement and joy to my daily life. These hobbies not only keep me balanced but also inspire me to approach life with curiosity and enthusiasm.

            <h2>An Excerpt from The Picture of Dorian Gray</h2>

            <div>

                <p>He had a special passion, also, for ecclesiastical vestments, as indeed he had for everything connected with the service of the Church. In the long cedar chests that lined the west gallery of his house, he had stored away many rare and beautiful specimens of what is really the raiment of the Bride of Christ, who must wear purple and jewels and fine linen that she may hide the pallid macerated body that is worn by the suffering that she seeks for and wounded by self-inflicted pain. He possessed a gorgeous cope of crimson silk and gold-thread damask, figured with a repeating pattern of golden pomegranates set in six-petalled formal blossoms, beyond which on either side was the pine-apple device wrought in seed-pearls. The orphreys were divided into panels representing scenes from the life of the Virgin, and the coronation of the Virgin was figured in coloured silks upon the hood. This was Italian work of the fifteenth century. Another cope was of green velvet, embroidered with heart-shaped groups of acanthus-leaves, from which spread long-stemmed white blossoms, the details of which were picked out with silver thread and coloured crystals. The morse bore a seraph's head in gold-thread raised work. The orphreys were woven in a diaper of red and gold silk, and were starred with medallions of many saints and martyrs, among whom was St. Sebastian. He had chasubles, also, of amber-coloured silk, and blue silk and gold brocade, and yellow silk damask and cloth of gold, figured with representations of the Passion and Crucifixion of Christ, and embroidered with lions and peacocks and other emblems; dalmatics of white satin and pink silk damask, decorated with tulips and dolphins and fleurs-de-lis; altar frontals of crimson velvet and blue linen; and many corporals, chalice-veils, and sudaria. In the mystic offices to which such things were put, there was something that quickened his imagination.</p>

<p>For these treasures, and everything that he collected in his lovely house, were to be to him means of forgetfulness, modes by which he could escape, for a season, from the fear that seemed to him at times to be almost too great to be borne. Upon the walls of the lonely locked room where he had spent so much of his boyhood, he had hung with his own hands the terrible portrait whose changing features showed him the real degradation of his life, and in front of it had draped the purple-and-gold pall as a curtain. For weeks he would not go there, would forget the hideous painted thing, and get back his light heart, his wonderful joyousness, his passionate absorption in mere existence. Then, suddenly, some night he would creep out of the house, go down to dreadful places near Blue Gate Fields, and stay there, day after day, until he was driven away. On his return he would sit in front of the picture, sometimes loathing it and himself, but filled, at other times, with that pride of individualism that is half the fascination of sin, and smiling with secret pleasure at the misshapen shadow that had to bear the burden that should have been his own.</p>
